Zharnel Hughes - The Fastest Pilot in the World

Conducted by Dominic Smith

Meet Zharnel Hughes, an Olympic sprinter representing Great Britain, who also enjoys the world of aviation, not only as an X-Plane enthusiast, but also as a private pilot.

In 2023, Zharnel set new British 100m and 200m sprint records, recording times of 9.83 and 19.73 seconds respectively. His achievement in the 100m sprint surpassed the previous record set by the legendary Linford Christie.

While competing in this year’s Olympics, Zharnel's dedication to his sport and his interest in flying continue to define his own incredible journey. Beyond the track, he explores the skies, bringing the same passion to his flying hobby as he does to his sprinting. Read on to learn more about Zharnel, and how he balances his athletic career with his love for aviation.

Introduction

How did you first get introduced to X-Plane, and what drew you to flight simulation?

I first got introduced to X-Plane thanks to my cousin Cordane. He was already a user of the sim and he knew I was all about aerodynamics and how the physics of this sim was top tier. Ever since that first flight, I’ve been hooked.

Can you tell us about your current X-Plane setup? I've heard you have a pretty impressive multi-screen and instrument configuration. What do you enjoy most about it?

I currently use two monitors. One is a 2K 37-inch monitor dedicated to the sim itself, and the other is for Navigraph charts.

Balancing Athletics & Flight Simulation

Given the demands of your athletic career, how do you manage to incorporate flight simulation into your schedule?

When it comes to flight simulation, I always find some time to spare. I typically reserve two mornings each week to log some sim hours, and I often use the weekends for extended sessions, especially when I don’t have other plans.

Does using X-Plane help you relax or give you a mental break from your athletic career?

Absolutely, 100%. Flying on X-Plane is my preferred way to relax. It's a complete mental escape that shifts my focus away from the track and into the skies, offering a refreshing break.

Getting Technical

What aspects of flight simulation do you find most fascinating? Is it the technical details, the realism, or the challenge of certain manoeuvres?

It’s definitely all of the above! I particularly love the challenge of executing ILS or RNAV approaches, especially in low IMC conditions. The thrill of these precise manoeuvres under challenging circumstances is what I find most exhilarating.

Do you have a particular aircraft or type of mission that you particularly enjoy in X-Plane? What makes it stand out to you?

I enjoy flying a range of aircraft, from general aviation to commercial, but the Zibo 737-800 holds a special place for me as I’ve logged the most hours in it. I’m also keen to experience flying the Flight Factor 777 in the future.

X-Plane Community & Learning

Have you connected with other X-Plane users or the flight simulation community? 

I certainly have! I’ve made a few friends on VATSIM, and we often communicate via DISCORD. Joining several virtual airlines has also allowed me to meet new people. It’s incredibly fun to connect with other users who share this passion for aviation. Surprisingly, there have been a few instances where people have recognized me from my athletics career on these networks, which is quite astounding!

Have you learned any new skills or gained knowledge through using X-Plane that you didn't expect?

X-Plane has taught me a great deal, which has significantly aided my real-life flying skills. It has boosted my confidence in managing radio communications, reading charts, understanding flight procedures, and overall handling of an airplane. These skills were unexpected gains but have proven invaluable.

Personal Insights

Can you share any memorable experiences or interesting stories from your time using X-Plane?

One standout moment was definitely having the chance to share my passion for aviation on Netflix, which drew some incredible reactions from fans! I also enjoy teaching my girlfriend a bit about airplanes, and we occasionally record those moments, making them even more special.

In what ways has your passion for aviation and flight simulation impacted or supported your athletic career?

I’d say it has helped me manage pressure and stay calm during tough situations. The focus and discipline I practice in flight simulation translate well to maintaining my composure on the track.

Considering your enthusiasm for flight simulation, have you also pursued real-life flying? If so, what certifications do you hold?

Funnily enough, you've hit on a significant part of my life as I do have a private pilot license! I fly a Cessna 152 and Cessna 172, which is thrilling. It’s great to apply what I’ve learned from simulators to actual flying.

o you see parallels between the disciplines required for flying and those necessary for professional athletics?

I certainly do! The focus and dedication needed in both flying and athletics complement each other well. After my athletics career, I hope to continue flying, even if it’s just for leisure. I’d probably prefer private jet flying or maybe contract flights in the Caribbean!

The Future

What improvements or new features would you like to see in future versions of X-Plane?

The visuals definitely need an upgrade! X-Plane has long mastered the physics, but enhancing the graphical elements is essential for a more immersive experience. Improvements in orthophotogrammetry could be a game-changer, attracting more users to this already amazing simulator.

What piece of advice would you offer to newcomers starting with X-Plane?

Embrace everything X-Plane has to offer. It’s the most realistic flight simulator available and can greatly sharpen your skills if you’re a real-life pilot. Plus, the community is fantastic and always ready to help with anything sim-related.

Apart from athletics and flight simulation, what other hobbies or interests do you pursue?

I love staying active, so swimming is a great outlet for me. I also have a passion for cooking and enjoy exploring new places, making traveling another favourite activity.

Can you share something about yourself that might surprise people?

Despite being quite adventurous in many areas of my life, I have a big fear of rats, I absolutely can’t stand them!

I'd like to thank Zharnel for taking the time to share his experiences with us, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors both on the track and in the skies.
