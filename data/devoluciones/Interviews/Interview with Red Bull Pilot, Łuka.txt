Interview with Red Bull Pilot, Łukasz Czepiela

Conducted by Dominic Smith

Introduction

From landing on a helipad above Dubai to flying passengers around Europe in an Airbus, Łukasz Czepiela has one of the most interesting flying careers out there. He’s known for his aerobatic performances, STOL competitions, and more recently, for pulling off one of the most talked-about landings in aviation.

In this exclusive interview with the Org, Luke talks about his early flying days, the story behind the Burj Al Arab stunt, and how flight sims continue to help in the real world.

Background and Early Flying Days

Luke, could I begin by asking what first got you into aviation? Was there a particular moment or person that sparked your passion for flying?

When I was six, my dad took me to an airshow, and I totally fell in love with flying. I did everything I could to be around planes. First with scale models, then free-flying ones, and finally started gliding at fifteen.

You have flown everything from air race planes to STOL aircraft. What was your first aircraft, and how did your flying career evolve from there?

When I was fifteen, I finally started flying gliders. My first glider was an SZD Puchacz, which is very popular in Poland. When I was nineteen, I moved to the UK and started my career as a babysitter. When the kids were in school, I used to run to Biggin Hill Airport and work for an engineering company. In exchange for my work, I got my PPL hours in a Cessna 152.

Red Bull Air Racing is one of the most intense competitions in aviation. What was the journey like to become a race pilot, and how did you prepare for such high-speed, precision flying?

My journey was incredibly long and difficult. I moved out of home at nineteen, worked fourteen-hour days across two jobs, seven days a week. When I finally became good enough at aerobatics, I took the last step required by RBAR. I borrowed a lot of money and went to the World Unlimited Aerobatic Championships, where I scored in the top 50 percent of pilots, which was the requirement for RBAR.

Career and Balancing Flying Roles

You’re known for your aerobatic and STOL flying, but what do you fly in your day job?  

On a daily basis, I fly an A320 for Wizz Air. Thanks to a lot of success in sport flying, Wizz Air supports me with my adventures. I work on a 50 percent contract, which also gives me time for the fun stuff.

Do passengers ever recognise you when you’re flying the A320?

Pretty often. Even today, flying to Abu Dhabi, we had passengers coming up to take a selfie after the landing.

Aerobatics and Stunt Flying

Your aerobatic routines are incredible. How do you prepare for complex manoeuvres, and what’s the most challenging stunt you’ve ever pulled off?  

In my show, I have figures that to the ordinary spectator look incredibly difficult and dangerous. We start training our routines up high at safe altitudes and then progressively bring them down as the season approaches. For me personally, the most difficult thing I’ve ever done in an aeroplane was the Bullseye landing. That project took over two years to prepare.

The Burj Al Arab landing really captured people’s imaginations. How did the idea for that come about?

After landing on a wooden pier in Sopot, Poland, I used to joke that the Carbon Cub is like a helicopter for poor people. That planted the seed for a helicopter-style challenge.

How did you pitch the idea to Red Bull? Were they on board right away, or did it take some convincing?

Once we decided it should be a landing on a helipad, my friend prepared a video in MSFS. We showed it to my athlete manager, who really liked the idea.

Why was the Burj Al Arab chosen? Were there other locations considered?

All the elevated helipads in Poland belong to hospitals, and no hospital would allow us to close theirs for a project. Since we had to go outside of Poland, we decided to go big. And what’s the most famous helipad in the world?

That kind of flying must have needed serious preparation. What went into making it possible, from training to logistics?

It was incredible how difficult the project turned out to be. You can land a STOL plane in two metres or less if the wind is strong, but on this building, any wind above 10 knots made it unflyable due to wake turbulence. No wind meant a longer landing distance.

I did around seven hundred practice landings on different circles painted on runways in Poland, the USA, and Dubai. Then there were aircraft modifications to prevent catastrophic failure in case of a tail strike, weight reductions, and all the necessary permits from the building and authorities. Plus, weather monitoring. Two years of hard work went into it.

How do you stay physically and mentally sharp for flights like these? 

I love my routines. To stay in basic shape, my two Belgian Shepherds are an incredible help. We go for long walks every day. I also do CrossFit-style training to build a strong core and protect my spine from G-forces. In summer, mountain biking is great for balance and general health, and in winter I do ski touring.

For the mind, I love sauna and cold plunges. It takes a strong head to stay in freezing water for several minutes at a time.

STOL and Unique Aircraft

What do you love most about STOL aircraft, and how different is the mindset compared to aerobatics or racing?

I think air racing and aerobatics helped me a lot to become great at STOL competition. Both sports are about energy management. Flying aerobatics on the edge of the flight envelope made me a much more competent pilot in STOL, not being scared to come in at stall speed.

That’s what helped me score second place in the STOL Drag at High Sierra and win the Valdez STOL competition.

Do you think STOL flying is becoming more popular, and what makes it so addictive? 

Oh, I love bush flying in the USA. It gives you such freedom. Landing pretty much anywhere and being out in nature.

When I went to High Sierra, we used to wake up before sunrise and land on a different mountaintop every day. Drinking coffee and watching the sun come up from under the wing of your plane, on top of a mountain, is amazing.

If you could fly any aircraft from history, STOL or otherwise, what would it be and why?  

The P-51. It’s simply lovely, beautiful, and has amazing performance.

X-Plane and Flight Simulators

How has flight simulation helped with your real-world flying? 

Sims are amazing tools for visualising the projects we want to do. When we went to Red Bull and the Burj Al Arab management, we had a video ready showing exactly what we wanted to do. A picture speaks a thousand words. Also, in the Air Race, we could try out different lines. But I believe the biggest help is in instrument flying. We saved a lot of time and money training my wife for her instrument rating by using sims at home.

Can sims help aspiring pilots develop good flying instincts?  

Yes, but do it smart. Simply flying around and doing silly things can ruin your progress in real life. Learning bad habits will take many hours to unlearn in a real aircraft, so be careful.

Final Thoughts

What’s next? Are there any upcoming projects you’re excited about? 

I’m working on two projects at the moment, but I can’t really talk about them yet. Keep an eye on my socials. They’ll be incredible.

If someone dreams of doing what you do, what advice would you give them?

Do it. Simply go out and try whatever it takes. Nothing is impossible. I came out of nowhere with no money, worked hard, and it all paid off.
