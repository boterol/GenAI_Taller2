Bomber County Gateway Trust: "On Freedom's Wings" Memorial Project - Interview

Conducted by Dominic Smith

Lincolnshire, affectionately known as “Bomber County,” has a deep aviation history that remains close to many hearts. Now, a new project called “On Freedom’s Wings” is taking shape to honour that legacy, offering a tribute to the Lancaster bomber and the brave crews who flew them.

I had the pleasure of speaking with Ken Sadler from the Bomber County Gateway Trust, the team behind this ambitious endeavour. In our interview, Ken discusses the inspiration for the landmark, the challenges they’ve faced, and the incredible support from the community and beyond. It’s a story of dedication, resilience, and a true passion for preserving history.

Introduction

Ken, can you begin by telling us a bit about the inspiration behind the "On Freedom’s Wings" project? What was the initial spark that led to the creation of this memorial?

Officially it’s a landmark rather than a memorial but of course people are free to find a connection however they wish. The UK has some outstanding landmarks, and it was felt that Lincolnshire’s identity as Bomber County was ripe for further recognition. After a very long period of being maligned, the memorial in Green Park, London righted that wrong and the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln then became the main source of records for Bomber Command. We just wanted a gate guard to the county that is an immediate visual connection to that proud heritage.

The Lancaster bomber holds a significant place in history. Why was it important for you to honour this particular aircraft and its crew?  

The landmark is representative of all aircraft associated with the county but for authenticity, there has to be the markings for a particular one. VN-N (R5689) happened to be the most photographed Lancaster during the period party because it featured prominently in a press day in the summer of 1942 when 50 Squadron received its first Lancasters at RAF Swinderby (around one mile away from the site). Research revealed that the same aircraft crashed close to the site in September 1942 with the loss of four of its seven crew. We even found small parts of the wreckage in the woodland, so the connection became inevitable.

What challenges have you faced so far in bringing the memorial to life, and how have you overcome them?

The project is entirely funded by public donations and the generosity of local businesses. We’ve reached out to the government and other authorities on numerous occasions but have received no tangible support. As a project, its cost would be at least £2million but we’ve progressed it so far with a fraction of that sum, having enjoyed donations of materials and labour from engineering and construction firms. All the trustees and the small fund-raising team have full-time jobs and have given everything for free to the project.

The design and scale of the memorial sound incredible. Can you walk us through some of the key features and details that visitors can expect?

It’s a full-size representation. We took a laser scan of Just Jane – the Lancaster forming part of the visitor centre at East Kirkby, Lincolnshire and engaged some very talented structural engineers and architects to produce the engineering drawings that reflect our vision. The structure will weigh around ninety-five tons, sitting atop a 25m high stanchion which itself is around twenty-six tons. We poured foundations containing 1300 tons of concrete – we want to prevent this Lancaster from actually taking off!  At 30m tall it's 50% taller than the Angel of the North and, for around 34000 motorists per day, it will appear as if the Lancaster is flying close to the horizon on the nearby hilltop.

What has the response been like from the local community and aviation enthusiasts so far? Has it met or exceeded your expectations?

Without the overwhelming support of the public, locally, county-wide, nationally and even internationally, it would have been difficult to keep going at times. We knew it would be well received and there was even a media scrum at the District Planning Committee meeting when the application was unanimously approved. I think the planners even leaked it to the press beforehand!  However, even we have been surprised by the emotion that it brings out in people. We have the most heart-wrenching letters on file from widows and other family-members telling us how their loved ones paid the ultimate price flying Lancasters, and cheques for sums that you suspect they can’t really afford – but it’s so important to them that future generations ask, “what is that and why is it there?”.

The East Midlands is known for its rich aviation heritage. How do you see the "On Freedom's Wings" project fitting into or enhancing that history?

The vast majority of Bomber Command, and indeed a large part of today’s RAF is based in the region. Lincolnshire has extensive heritage trails that draw visitors in, and we see this as the number one sign that visitors have arrived in the area. 

Are there any stories or moments from working on this project that have stood out to you personally?

We were so honoured to have a dozen veterans break the ground for us at a large ceremony on site, including Dambuster, George “Johnny” Johnson. Johnny was guest speaker at our fundraising dinner which raised almost £30,000 on the night and he was such a gentleman and enthusiastic supporter. Sadly, hardly any of those veterans are with us anymore which is heart-breaking because we promised to have it finished for them to see. But we completed the structural frame only last week and displayed it at the yard of our fabrication partners, Timmins Engineering & Construction, for friends and families of those involved to see. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight provided a fly-over in “Thumper” which was very special. They even took a “recon” photo of us as they flew over and were very excited to discuss it all afterwards.

For those who want to support the project, what ways can people get involved or contribute?

We need to raise around £50,000 more to purchase the steel for the final stage, which is the application of the skin. If you’d like to support the project, there’s a donation button available on our website:

Looking ahead, what are the next major steps for the project, and when can people expect to see it completed?

The timescale has continually slipped because of Covid, other crises and the fact that we are building the landmark without any official funding. However, we are planning to erect at least part of the finished sections on site sometime next year, assuming that we are able to raise the funds going forward.

Finally, what do you hope visitors and future generations take away from the experience of visiting the memorial?

Personally, we’d like to think it provokes some pride in the area, what Britain can and has achieved when absolutely necessary and to halt the decline in our values. But others will have different hopes, personal to themselves and they’re probably more important.

The 'On Freedom’s Wings' project is a remarkable tribute to those who served and sacrificed in the skies. As it comes together, it will not only honour the past but also keep the legacy of the Lancaster and its crews alive for future generations.
