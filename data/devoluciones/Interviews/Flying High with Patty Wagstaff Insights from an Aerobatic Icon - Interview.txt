Flying High with Patty Wagstaff: Insights from an Aerobatic Icon - Interview

Conducted by Dominic Smith

Welcome to our exclusive interview with Patty Wagstaff, one of the world's most respected and talented aerobatic pilots.

With a career that spans decades, Patty has not only competed at the highest levels but also passionately teaches the next generation at her flight school in St. Augustine, Florida.

In this interview, Patty opens up about how she first fell in love with flying, her journey to becoming a three-time national aerobatic champion, and her experiences in aviation. She also shares her thoughts on the challenges and future of aerobatic airshows.

Personal

What sparked your love for aviation, and how did it lead you to become a pilot?

Airplanes have always been a part of my life. I vividly remember being in my dad’s B-25 when I was about three years old; it was so cool!  New places, new adventures, just made me love everything about flying from a very young age.

Where did you first learn to fly, and who were your mentors during this time? What types of aircraft did you train in?

My journey as a pilot began in Alaska, starting out in Dillingham, a small fishing village in Bristol Bay in the Southwest part of the state. I also spent time training in Anchorage, where I completed my ratings. My very first experience piloting a small plane was in a Cessna 185, taking off from Lake Hood on floats. Living in Dillingham, I took lessons in both a Cessna and a Cherokee. I had some great instructors, including my then-husband.

When and where did you complete your first solo flight, and what stands out to you about that experience?

I took my first solo flight in 1980 at Birchwood Airport, just outside of Anchorage, Alaska. I vividly remember thinking, "I can't believe they're letting me do this!" But they did, and I've never looked back since!

When did you first become an owner of your own aircraft, and what types were they?

My husband Bob and I first owned a Cessna 185, and later we purchased a BE-55 Baron. However, my first aerobatic airplane was a 1977 Super Decathlon.

Aerobatics

What inspired you to pursue aerobatics, and when did you begin your training?

I've always had a keen interest in aerobatics for some reason, even though I’d never been to an airshow.  I started taking lessons as soon as I found an instructor in Anchorage.  However, it was when I attended an airshow and witnessed the incredible flying skills and camaraderie among the pilots that my interest truly solidified. That experience made it clear to me that aerobatics was exactly what I wanted to do.

Where did you practice your aerobatics, and what kind of training was necessary to achieve your current level of proficiency?

I’ve always approached both flight training and aerobatic training as very methodical processes. It’s essential to take steps one at a time. I started with lessons, and then practiced solo, always high up, gradually adding manoeuvres to my repertoire. Even today, I need to practice regularly to maintain my G tolerance level.

What fitness regime do you follow to maintain your G tolerances?

Fitness is integral to my lifestyle. I engage in biking, horse riding, working out, yoga, and generally maintain an athletic lifestyle. However, when it comes to maintaining G tolerance, nothing beats being in the cockpit as frequently as possible.

What were some of the first aerobatic manoeuvres you performed solo in an aircraft?

I believe the first aerobatic manoeuvres I executed on my own were a loop, a roll, and a spin.

What advice would you give to young people today interested in getting into aerobatics?

Definitely start with lessons! We’ve established an aerobatic school in St. Augustine, Florida, where you can experience your first taste of aerobatics and learn the basics, but there are a lot of places across the country where you can get a start.  I would also say it’s important to join the International Aerobatic Club, or IAC, to get more information and to subscribe to their newsletter and magazine (www.iac.org)

Your aerobatics school sounds fantastic! Are there any specific requirements for joining, such as prior flight experience, age, or fitness level?

Anyone is welcome to fly with us, as long as they are a pilot and want to improve their flying skills! We don't have age restrictions; we invite anyone eager to become a better, more skilled, and more confident pilot. Remember, when you're trained in aerobatics, there are no unusual attitudes!

What is it about the EXTRA 300 that you prefer over other aerobatic aircraft?

The Extra series stands out among aerobatic airplanes; they're certified production aircraft that are both strong and lightweight. Remarkably, there has never been a recorded structural failure in an Extra. They're not only safe, reliable, and honest, but they also offer a beautiful harmony of controls that makes them a joy to fly.

What is the most challenging aerobatic manoeuvre you've performed, and why is it so difficult?

The most challenging manoeuvre I perform is probably the snap rolling 360-degree turn. It's particularly tough because it demands intense practice to master coordination and avoid disorientation.

Who are some of the people you admire in the aerobatic community?

I've been fortunate to have wonderful friends and fantastic coaching in the world of aerobatics. There are so many people I look up to; individuals like Clint McHenry, Bob Herendeen, Debbie Gary, Jimmy Franklin, Bobby Younkin, and Leo Loudenslager stand out. However, I truly admire anyone who can carve out a living in this challenging field!

Who was your first ever sponsor, and who are your sponsors now? What role do they play in your aerobatic flying and your school of aerobatic training?

I've been fortunate enough to have many wonderful sponsors throughout my career. Goodrich Aerospace was a very long-term sponsor, but all their divisions have since been bought up by other companies. I have had a lot of help from sponsors such as MT Propeller, Bose Headsets, Sarasota Avionics, MT Propeller, Champion Aerospace, and Concorde Battery.   

The Future

Where do you see the business of aerobatic airshows heading, and what changes might we expect in the future?

Airshows have been a staple of aviation almost since its inception, beginning shortly after the Wright Brothers' first flight in 1903. Pilots were quick to showcase their aerobatic skills to the public. I believe as long as we have 'people-powered' airplanes, rather than fully autonomous, computer-controlled ones, airshows will continue.

Even when headline acts like the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds were impacted by budget constraints, smaller airshows still went ahead, much to the delight of large crowds.

What are some of the challenges and goals you have set for yourself going forward?

I’m as busy as ever with flying airshows and operating our aerobatic and upset training school, Patty Wagstaff Aviation Safety. I love having a project and for the past several years have produced several videos with Sporty’s Pilot Shop including Basic Aerobatics and Tailwheel Checkout. We are working on a new one at the moment. I have started a Foundation as well, whose purpose is to improve aviation safety by offering advanced training to pilots who are going into aviation as a career. I’m also working on a small book of stories, so there are lots of things keeping me busy and out of trouble!

Thank you, Patty, for taking the time to share your insights with us at X-Plane.Org. We are honoured you chose to spend this time with us, and it has been an absolute pleasure speaking with you.

From the entire team at X-Plane.Org, we wish you every success in the future.
