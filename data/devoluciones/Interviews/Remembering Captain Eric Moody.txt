Remembering Captain Eric Moody

Conducted by Dominic Smith

In June 1982, British Airways Flight 009 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash near Indonesia. All four engines failed, and for a time, the aircraft became a glider. Captain Eric Moody was at the controls that night, and his calm leadership helped bring everyone home safely.

Over ten years ago, Eric kindly took part in an interview with me, during which he spoke not only about that night, but also about his long career in aviation. The transcript was taken from an old audio recording and wasn’t the easiest to follow, so it’s been reviewed and tidied to improve the flow. The aim has been to make it easier to read while keeping Eric’s words and style exactly as they were.

With Eric’s passing in 2024, and thanks to the kind permission of his wife, Pat, I’m honoured to share his story again.

Getting Started in Aviation

Eric, could you tell me how you first got into flying, and what those early days were like?

I wanted to fly from about the age of four, originally as a fighter pilot. We lived on the edge of the New Forest at the time, and my father knew several BOAC aircrews, including pilots, navigators and radio officers, so I spent time talking with them. By the age of eight I had changed my ambition to become a BOAC pilot, indeed a BOAC Captain.

At school I attended a Combined Cadet Force and joined the RAF section. We flew with them; it was like an enhanced Air Training Corps. I had flights in Ansons, Chipmunks and other odd types. At sixteen I learned to glide and earned both my A and B gliding licences. The following year I was awarded an RAF flying scholarship, which I believe still exists though now administered by civilian authorities, to fund thirty hours of flying at a cost of around £300 or £350 in 1958.

Imagine spending £300 today: when I retired in 1996 I owned three aeroplanes and you could not have bought two hours on the smallest for that sum. In any case, that scholarship gave me thirty hours and my Private Pilot’s Licence on a Hornet Moth, a Tiger Moth and some spinning sessions in the Chipmunk. At seventeen I was fully licenced.

I then joined the Hampshire Aeroplane Club at Eastleigh, beside Southampton Airport, when it was still a grass field with no hard runway, no radio and only varied lights, flares and Aldis lamp signals, quite primitive at the time. Aviation, after all, is barely 110 years old.

More than fifty years ago, I continued flying at the aero club and befriended many instructors from what was then the Air Service Training at Hamble on the River Itchen. They provided tuition for both engineers and pilots. I learned that BOAC and BEA intended to acquire AST and establish a college modelled on Cranwell to produce their own civil pilots.

The Crooked Nose Setback

What happened when you started pursuing that dream? Did anything get in your way early on?

I intended to join the RAF on a short service commission, as many did, but I stayed an extra year at school. In 1960 I was among the first to interview and be accepted to the College of Air Training. I thought everything was set. I was due to start at the end of August and about two weeks earlier the College sent a letter stating that on reassessment I was medically unfit.

That was a huge blow. My father and I protested, enlisting others to contest the decision, but the College refused to reconsider. Three issues were listed, two of which were clearly spurious and the third almost as far-fetched. Ultimately, they settled on the one real point, my nose was slightly crooked, and that apparently rendered me unfit.

I asked if I could join the next intake, since I had never failed a Ministry of Aviation medical (the Ministry itself had pronounced me fit), but the College maintained I was unfit. They argued they needed to ensure trainees would serve at least twenty-eight years. That struck me as absurd, but that was airline management for you.

They had decided to run three courses of fourteen cadets each and initially selected fifty candidates, knowing some might fail exams. They then rejected eight of us, myself included, on trivial medical grounds, crooked noses, ingrowing toenails and the like. It was dreadful.

My father arranged for me to see an ENT specialist in Southampton. The specialist examined me and declined to operate as ethically he could not alter something that minor and risk making it worse. He suggested I return at twenty-one, since bones and cartilage settle every seven years.

On my twenty-first birthday, 7 June 1962, I went back. He said nothing had changed and again refused. I pleaded until he agreed to see me in October. Ten days later he performed nasal surgery under local anaesthetic to straighten the septum. It took about an hour, and I heard the squelching and scraping. Near the end he announced, ‘You’ll feel this,’ then said, ‘Hammer, nurse, chisel,’ as he removed parts of bone.

I wrote to BOAC with proof that my nose was now straight and they agreed to re-run the interview and repeat the medical. My then girlfriend (now wife) and I travelled to Heathrow one cold January morning in 1963. In the BOAC medical centre I met Dr Sybil, the infamous aviation physician known for packing expletives into a sentence and still making sense. He read my file, cursed, then asked, ‘You went through all that pain just to be a pilot?’ I replied that I was keen. He gestured to his own horribly crooked nose and said he would not have the surgery. A few minutes later he handed me a signed letter from himself and Dr Petler, the senior medical officer, declaring me fit. ‘Now off you go and have a good life,’ he said. ‘And don’t make me look up your nose.’

Flying the VC10 and Early Routes

After all that hassle with the medicals, what happened next? Is that when the VC10 came in?

I spent two years at the College of Air Training at Hamble. I loved it and graduated in August 1965 with 200 hours on the Chipmunk, another 70 or so on the Apache, my commercial pilot’s licence and all the necessary ratings.

BOAC, my sponsor, then informed us in June that there were no jobs likely with them in the foreseeable future but that they had secured positions for us at BEA. I’ve never been a fan of short-haul flying, still am not, but I trained on the Vanguard and soon found myself on Amber 1 sectors: Heathrow to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester, with occasional trips to Gibraltar, Palma or Malta.

A Vanguard with its four mighty Tyne engines was quite the machine, very British in character. I didn’t relish the work, but it was flying. In the first week of January, I married and moved into a new house. Soon after I spotted a BOAC advertisement in Flight magazine stating that they needed pilots, just six or seven months after saying they would not recruit. I wrote to remind them they had paid for my training and that I wanted to join them. They replied that a no-poaching agreement with BEA prevented an immediate transfer.

After a long struggle involving forty-one others, we secured permission to complete the summer season at BEA and transfer to BOAC in the autumn. On 31 October 1965 I became a BOAC pilot and began VC10 training. We also had to gain a Navigation Licence, since navigation then meant sticking a sextant out of the cockpit, shooting the stars, drawing lines on charts and finding fixes. Navigation has changed dramatically since those days.

Our sectors rarely exceeded ten hours, often with a European stop en route. Geneva, Zurich or Frankfurt were regular calls, then on to the Middle East: Beirut was one of my favourites, followed by Baghdad, Damascus, Tel Aviv, Bahrain and Karachi. We seldom flew beyond Singapore on the VC10, though Colombo and trans-African routes did feature since the aeroplane was built for rough, short runways.

Pilots who earned a strong reputation sometimes flew the Atlantic too, serving New York, Bermuda and the Caribbean. It was a varied lifestyle which I loved. As First Officer I witnessed the VC10’s remarkable performance; it outclimbed many military jets. I recall an unofficial race in Lima with an RAF Vulcan where we left them trailing behind. In those days such antics went unnoticed; modern monitoring systems make them a risk.

Life on the 747

So, after your time on the VC10, how did the move to the 747 come about? What was it like flying such a large airliner back then?

I served as a First Officer on the VC10 until 1970, when the first 747s arrived at BOAC. They acquired five or six aircraft and invited First Officers to volunteer for training. Some were reluctant to try a new type; I was not. Being among the first 747 First Officers was a fantastic experience. I volunteered, only for BALPA, the pilots’ union, to ground the fleet briefly, perhaps a blessing given the early Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3 engines. Those engines struggled to reach cruising speed across the Atlantic, yet flying the 747 was tremendous fun despite frequent engine failures. I remember one night when our entire fleet was stranded between London and Johannesburg because one jet had lost a turbine, another was diverting to Istanbul in search of a replacement, and we had to supply the spare engine.

I flew the 747 until 1976, then took up a command on the VC10 as I wanted my captaincy and I prefer Boeings. The VC10 fleet was winding down by then, so from about 1981 I returned to the 747-200 as captain for around four years before that series was phased out. In 1990 I trained on the 747-400 and finished my career on that type.

I was never keen on full automation. I valued having a flight engineer on board. Automated systems, in my experience, can be less efficient under high workload, with notices and messages scrolling so fast they overwhelm the human brain. I would not have welcomed facing my 1982 incident in a 747-400 cockpit.

The 1982 Jakarta Incident

Can you take me back to that night in 1982, what happened with the St Elmo’s Fire and the engines?

We were at 37,000 feet when it began. I had stepped out to use the forward lavatory, found someone inside, so decided to check on the cabin and use the aft loo. Returning up the stairs I saw what looked like smoke at floor level in the flight deck and smelled burning electricals. I half-expected an electrical fire, but instead my colleagues were transfixed by an intense display of St Elmo’s Fire across the windscreen: shimmering columns of discharge that grew more vivid, with short flashes like lightning.

While we watched, the flight engineer reported that engine four had failed. Within thirty seconds all four had stopped, unusually rapid even for a single-engine failure. For the next thirteen minutes we descended under autopilot from 37,000 to 12,000 feet, despite instruments indicating total electrical failure. That confused us; in the simulator, a four-engine failure pops the autopilot out and sounds a warning, neither of which happened in the aircraft.

When I saw our speed decaying, I disengaged altitude hold and elected a controlled descent of about 1,200 feet per minute, diverting off airway toward Jakarta. With all engines still off, I made a calm PA announcement:

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have suffered total engine failure. We are doing our utmost to restore power. I trust you are not too distressed. Chief Steward, please come to the flight deck.”

Shortly afterwards, at about 13,000 feet, engine four wound up slowly and restarted. Although the procedure advised against it, we reinstated that engine since it was the least damaged. Thirty seconds later engine three came back online, followed by engines one and two a further thirty seconds after. By fifteen minutes after the first failure, all four engines were running again.

Over western Java there are many volcanoes; knowing our safety height was 10,500 feet, I climbed to 15,000 feet at Jakarta’s request, but the St Elmo’s Fire returned intensely. I throttled back to descend, only for engine two to begin a violent surge, ejecting flames and jarring the aircraft. After several jolts I ordered it shut down, making five engine failures in twenty minutes.

We landed on three engines with windscreens partially opaque and no glideslope. I sat forward, reached thrust levers carefully and used the localiser plus visual cues. We touched down within ten feet of the terminal and were towed in. Next morning the windscreens were almost opaque, just two-inch strips showing outwards.

From left to right: the landing light lens, made from a much softer material than the windscreen, was left completely sandblasted by the volcanic ash; next to it, one of the turbine stator blades from the hot section of an engine shows how the ash welded itself onto the surface.

When you think back to that flight, what stands out most about the way you and the crew handled it?

The flight engineer that night was outstanding. He anticipated failures and worked tirelessly. I have never seen anyone sweat so much in the cockpit; he was determined because, as you can imagine, we all wanted to live. Many of the crew were tough Yorkshiremen; I come from Hampshire and like to think we have our own kind of resolve.

At the time we knew nothing of what is now called Crew Resource Management. The RAF’s equivalent Aircrew journal published an Australian military article praising our teamwork as a prime example. Today the Civil Aviation Authority requires proof of such skills before issuing licences. It feels like bureaucracy: you either have good teamwork or you do not. I prefer to call it airmanship, a term I grew up with and which remains essential.

I also discovered that pilots bear the blame when procedures are lacking. After our incident there was nothing in manuals about volcanic ash or St Elmo’s Fire. Only around 2008 did guidance emerge to reduce thrust at the first sign of discharge. It seems absurd that experts pore over diagrams for years and then issue a new procedure while expecting pilots to decide in seconds. In my career I often thought, “You have had six months to think about it; I have just six seconds.” A pilot is always in the wrong unless he can prove his innocence.

After everything you’ve been through, is there anything you’d say to someone starting out today?

Yes. Never give up. Illegitimi non carborundum, never let the b****s grind you down. Keep trying and you will get there. I have never met a decent pilot who did not face obstacles, my crooked-nose saga is just one example. Life is like a steeplechase: you must clear each fence.

A sincere thank you to Eric Moody for sharing his time, memories and kindness during the original interview. And a very special thanks to his wife, Pat, for allowing this to be published again.
